# Dark Hugo Researcher

A dark variant of the Researcher theme for Hugo. The original was ported from Jekyll theme
[ankitsultana/researcher](https://github.com/ankitsultana/researcher), but I decided a dark theme would be something nice to have.

## Installation

Add the theme to your site's `themes` directory:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/cdohara/dark-hugo-researcher.git themes/dark-hugo-researcher
# if your website is not managed by git:
# git clone https://github.com/cdohara/dark-hugo-researcher.git themes/dark-hugo-researcher
```

Update the theme option in `config.toml`:
```toml
theme = "dark-hugo-researcher"
```

Generally, you can follow the same installation instructions in [ojroques/hugo-researcher](https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher).
